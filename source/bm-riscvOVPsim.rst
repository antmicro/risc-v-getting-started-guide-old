riscvOVPsim - a free simulator
==============================

To execute programs compiled for the RISC-V ISA requires a software simulator or a hardware implementation of a RISC-V processor.

The riscvOVPsim simulator is a software implementation (an Instruction Set Simulator) that implements the full and complete functionality of the RISC-V Foundation's public User and Privilege specifications.

The simulator is command line configurable to enable/disable all current optional and processor specific options. The industrial quality model and simulator of RISC-V processors is used for application, program, compliance and test development. It has been developed for personal, academic, or commercial use, and the CPU model is provided as open source under the Apache 2.0 license. 

riscvOVPsim has full commercial features including variant selection, comprehensive trace, GDB/Eclipse graphical source code debug, semihosting, and RISC-V foundation signature dump facility for compliance testing.
